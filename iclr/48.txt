ABSTRACT

Deep residual networks (ResNets) and their variants are widely used in many com-
puter vision applications and natural language processing tasks. However, the
theoretical principles for designing and training ResNets are still not fully under-
stood. Recently, several points of view have emerged to try to interpret ResNet
theoretically, such as unraveled view, unrolled iterative estimation and dynami-
cal systems view. In this paper, we adopt the dynamical systems point of view,
and analyze the lesioning properties of ResNet both theoretically and experimen-
tally. Based on these analyses, we additionally propose a novel method for ac-
celerating ResNet training. We apply the proposed method to train ResNets and
Wide ResNets for three image classiﬁcation benchmarks, reducing training time
by more than 40% with superior or on-par accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

Deep neural networks have powered many research areas from computer vision (He et al., 2016;
Huang et al., 2017b), natural language processing (Cho et al., 2014) to biology (Esteva et al., 2017)
and e-commerce (Ha et al., 2016). Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) (He et al., 2016), and their
variants such as Wide ResNets (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) and DenseNets (Huang et al.,
2017b), are among the most successful architectures. In ResNets, the authors employ identity skip-
connections that bypass residual layers, allowing data to ﬂow from previous layers directly to any
subsequent layers.
With the success of ResNet and its variants on various applications (He et al., 2016; 2017; Pohlen
et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2017; Oord et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016), several views such as unraveled
view (Veit et al., 2016), unrolled iterative estimation view (Greff et al., 2017) and dynamical systems
view (Haber et al., 2017; E, 2017; Chang et al., 2017) have emerged to try to interpret ResNets
through theoretical analysis and empirical results. These views provide preliminary interpretations,
however, deep understanding of ResNets is still an active on-going research topic (Jastrzebski et al.,
2017; Li et al., 2016; Hardt & Ma, 2017; Li & Yuan, 2017).
The dynamical systems view interprets ResNets as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a special
kind of dynamical systems (Haber et al., 2017; E, 2017), opening up possibilities of exploiting the
computational and theoretical success from dynamical systems to ResNets. From this point of view,
stable and reversible architectures (Haber & Ruthotto, 2017; Chang et al., 2017) are developed.
However, few empirical analysis of this view has been done and many phenomena such as the
removing of layers not leading to performance drop are not explained by the dynamical systems
view. In this work, we take steps forward to complement this dynamical systems view with empirical
analysis of its properties and the lesion studies.
